## Aim: 
Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)
Experiment: Develop a comprehensive report for the following exercises:

Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.
Focusing on Generative AI architectures. (like transformers).
Generative AI applications.
Generative AI impact of scaling in LLMs.

## Algorithm:
1. Collect & preprocess data
2. Train model on data patterns
3. Generate new content from model
4. Evaluate & improve output
## Output
[Report on Foundational Concepts of Generative AI.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22056309/Report.on.Foundational.Concepts.of.Generative.AI.pdf)

## Result
The study of Generative AI shows that its core lies in learning data distributions through advanced architectures like GANs, VAEs, diffusion models, and transformers. Scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) enhances creativity, reasoning, and performance but also raises challenges in cost, ethics, and accessibility and the report was created successfully by using prompt engineering.
